# iceberg_table (Data Source)

Reads metadata for an existing Iceberg table from the catalog.

Use this data source to inspect tables created outside Terraform, to reference tables managed in another workspace, or to read the current catalog state of a table also managed by an [`iceberg_table` resource](../resources/table.md).

## Example Usage

### Read a table by namespace and name

```terraform
data "iceberg_table" "events" {
  namespace = ["analytics", "prod"]
  name      = "events"
}

output "events_table_id" {
  value = data.iceberg_table.events.id
}

output "events_id_column" {
  value = data.iceberg_table.events.schema.fields[0].name
}
```

### Read a table managed by this provider

```terraform
resource "iceberg_namespace" "example" {
  name = ["example_namespace"]
}

resource "iceberg_table" "example" {
  namespace = iceberg_namespace.example.name
  name      = "example_table"

  schema = {
    fields = [
      {
        name     = "id"
        type     = "long"
        required = true
      }
    ]
  }
}

data "iceberg_table" "example" {
  depends_on = [iceberg_table.example]

  namespace = iceberg_namespace.example.name
  name      = iceberg_table.example.name
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the table.
- `namespace` (List of String) The namespace of the table.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Dot-separated full table identifier (namespace segments and table name).
- `partition_spec` (Attributes) The partition spec of the table. Empty when the table is not partitioned. Nested field shapes match the [`iceberg_table` resource](../resources/table.md#nestedatt--partition_spec).
- `schema` (Attributes) The current schema of the table. Nested field shapes match the [`iceberg_table` resource](../resources/table.md#nestedatt--schema); all nested attributes are computed on read.
- `server_properties` (Map of String) Properties from table metadata as returned by the catalog (the same values surfaced as `server_properties` on the table resource after apply).
- `sort_order` (Attributes) The sort order of the table. Empty when the table is unsorted. Nested field shapes match the [`iceberg_table` resource](../resources/table.md#nestedatt--sort_order).

## Error handling

- If the table does not exist, apply fails with a **Table not found** error.
- If `catalog_uri` is not configured on the provider, apply fails with **Catalog not available**.
