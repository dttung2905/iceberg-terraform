# Iceberg Terraform Provider

This [Terraform](https://terraform.io) and [OpenTofu](https://www.opentofu.org/) provider allows you to manage Iceberg resources, such as namespaces and tables.

## Supported Data Sources

- `iceberg_namespace`: Read metadata for an existing namespace (catalog properties).
- `iceberg_table`: Read metadata for an existing table (schema, partition spec, sort order, and catalog properties).

## Supported Resources

- `iceberg_namespace`: Manage Iceberg namespaces and their properties.
- `iceberg_table`: Manage Iceberg tables, including schema definitions and properties.
- `iceberg_polaris_principal`: Manage Polaris principals and client credentials (when using a Polaris catalog).

See the [provider documentation](docs/index.md) for examples and attribute reference.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (1.25.1 or later)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/)

### Building the Provider

To build the provider and install it locally , run the `build.sh` script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This script will:
1. Compile the provider binary.
2. Create a local provider registry at `./terraform-plugins`.
3. Provide a configuration snippet for your `~/.terraformrc` (or `terraform.rc`) file to point Terraform to this local registry.
